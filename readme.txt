At a railway station, we have the following time-table with the arrivals and departures of trains.

Train		Arrivals	Departures
Train A		9:00		9:30
Train B		9:15		13:00
Train C		10:30		11:00
Train D		10:45		11:45

Write a program to find the minimum number of platforms so that all the trains can be accommodated.

Add 4 more trains (E,F,G,H) to the time table and run your program again to find the minimum number of platforms needed. 
Please choose reasonable arrival and departure times for the trains E, F, G, H.
